## Database Schema

The application uses a relational PostgreSQL database with the following tables:

- **events** - Upcoming events with dates and locations

All tables include proper foreign key constraints, indexes for performance, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Supabase account
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd relife-party-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Supabase**
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the migration files in the `supabase/migrations/` directory
   - Get your project URL and anon key from the Supabase dashboard

4. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Database Setup

The database migrations are located in `supabase/migrations/`. These should be run in your Supabase project to set up the complete schema with:

- All required tables with proper constraints
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Indexes for optimal performance
- Foreign key relationships

### Authentication Setup

The application uses Supabase Auth with email/password authentication. To set up the first admin user:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication ‚Üí Users
3. Create a new user with email and password
4. The user will automatically have access to the admin dashboard
